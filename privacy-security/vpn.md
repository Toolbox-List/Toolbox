## IP / DNS Leak Checkers

*Use an IP / DNS leak checker every time you connect to your VPN. **Especially if you are going to torrent something.***

## VPNs that you should avoid

*I recommend picking a VPN from the Paid VPN list above.*

- [**HolaVPN**](https://hola.org/) - Peer-to-peer VPN that is not private at all.
- [**PureVPN**](https://purevpn.com)
- [**IPVanish**](https://ipvanish.com) - Gave logs to Homeland Security. Now owned by a different company, but I would still avoid it for now; there are many better options available.
